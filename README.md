# PRG1_Asst
A Python-based application that processes HDB carpark availability data. It reads CSV files, displays carpark info, filters by availability, and identifies full or largest carparks. Advanced features include location-based search and sorted output generation. Uses lists, dictionaries, and file handling for data processing and validation.

This repository contains a Python-based application developed for processing HDB carpark availability data. The program reads and analyzes datasets to provide insights into carpark occupancy, availability trends, and filtering based on user queries.
